# Micro- and Nanoplastics: Crossing the Blood-Brain Barrier to Drive Sustained Neuroinflammation and HPA Axis Dysregulation

This repository contains the Quarto source code and supporting files for an academic paper submitted for the **Immunology (BT335IU)** Scientific Writing Assignment.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

The paper explores the neurotoxic potential of Micro- and Nanoplastics (MNPs), focusing on their ability to traverse the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), trigger sustained microglial activation, and lead to HPA axis dysregulation and subsequent neurocognitive deficits.

* **Topic:** Immune Response Under Environmental Stress.
* **Course:** Immunology (BT335IU)
* **Author:** Tran Quoc Hoang
* **Submission Deadline:** 31 October 2025

## 🛠️ Reproducibility and Technical Details

This project is built using **Quarto** and **R (RStudio)** for dynamic document generation, ensuring a fully reproducible workflow.

### Source Files

* **Main Document Source:** `TranQuocHoang_IM25_Newsletter.qmd`
* **Bibliography:** `IM25_Newsletter.bib` (Managed via Zotero + Better BibTeX)

### Environment Setup

The project environment is managed using **`renv`**, ensuring that the exact R package versions used to generate the final output are preserved.

1.  **Restore the Environment:** To install the exact package dependencies, open the project in R and run:
    ```r
    renv::restore()
    ```
    This will use the **`renv.lock`** file to set up the necessary environment, including the **`apaquarto`** package.

2.  **Render the Document:** Once the environment is restored, the final Word document (`.docx` file) can be regenerated by running the following Quarto command (Befehl):
    ```bash
    quarto render TranQuocHoang_IM25_Newsletter.qmd --to apaquarto-docx
    ```
    The final submission document is generated in **APA 7th Edition format** for Microsoft Word.
