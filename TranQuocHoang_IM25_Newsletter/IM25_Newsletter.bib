  abstract = {Humans are continuously exposed to polymeric materials such as in textiles, car tires and packaging. Unfortunately, their break down products pollute our environment, leading to widespread contamination with micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs). The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is an important biological barrier that protects the brain from harmful substances. In our study we performed short term uptake studies in mice with orally administered polystyrene micro-/nanoparticles (9.55 µm, 1.14 µm, 0.293 µm). We show that nanometer sized particles—but not bigger particles—reach the brain within only 2 h after gavage. To understand the transport mechanism, we performed coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations on the interaction of DOPC bilayers with a polystyrene nanoparticle in the presence and absence of various coronae. We found that the composition of the biomolecular corona surrounding the plastic particles was critical for passage through the BBB. Cholesterol molecules enhanced the uptake of these contaminants into the membrane of the BBB, whereas the protein model inhibited it. These opposing effects could explain the passive transport of the particles into the brain.},

  abstract = {Micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs), originating from plastic wastes degradation, industrial processes, and textile fiber shedding, persist in the environment and act as carriers of hazardous substances, posing significant global health risks. Growing evidence links MNPs exposure to neurotoxicity; however, substantial knowledge gaps remain regarding their environmental distribution, cellular effects, and epidemiological consequences. This review systematically examines the sources and exposure pathways of MNPs, as well as their potential contribution to neurological disorders. It outlines key neurotoxic effects, including neuronal damage, synaptic dysfunction, blood-brain barrier disruption, neuroinflammation, and protein aggregation, which may contribute to cognitive decline and motor impairments. Additionally, it explores the underlying mechanisms of MNPs-induced toxicity, such as oxidative stress, immune responses, mitochondrial dysfunction, cell death signaling, and the gut-brain axis. Given the complexity of MNPs interactions, the study highlights the need for future research on coexposure effects with other pollutants and their impact on MNPs toxicity. Finally, this article advocates for stricter MNPs pollution control, advancements in detection technologies, and a deeper understanding of neurotoxic mechanisms, emphasizing the necessity of interdisciplinary collaboration to assess and mitigate associated health risks.},

  abstract = {The brain is endowed with highly specialized vasculature that is both structurally and functionally unique compared to vasculature supplying peripheral organs. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) of the cerebral vasculature prevents extravasation of blood products into the brain to protect neural tissue and maintain a homeostatic environment. The BBB also functions as part of a neurovascular unit (NVU), which is comprised of neurons, astrocytes, and microglia in addition to the specialized endothelial cells, mural cells, and the basement membrane of the BBB. Through coordinated intercellular signaling, these cells function as a dynamic unit to tightly regulate brain blood flow, vascular function, neuroimmune responses, and waste clearance. In this chapter, we review the functions of individual NVU components, describe neurovascular coupling as a classic example of NVU function, and discuss archetypal NVU pathophysiology during disease.},

  abstract = {Microplastics and nanoplastics (MNPs) have gained attention as pervasive environmental pollutants that pose a risk to human health. This review provides comprehensive and updated scientific information on how MNPs enter the human body through multiple routes such as inhalation, ingestion, and dermal contact, and circulate through the bloodstream to get deposited in various organs. Its focus revolves around the toxicological effects caused by MNPs on human health, specifically on vital organ systems such as the respiratory, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, nervous, immune, reproductive, endocrine, and urinary systems. Important findings indicate that MNP exposure may result in oxidative stress (OS), inflammation, impaired biochemical and energy metabolism, altered morphology and proliferation, diminished cellular metabolic activity, immune dysfunction, cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, disrupted microbial metabolic pathways, developmental abnormalities, and carcinogenicity. The toxicological effects of MNPs depend upon many factors such as their size, type, concentration, and charge. The review has also highlighted the knowledge gaps in current research. Despite evidence from cellular and animal studies, human studies on the toxic effects of MNPs are limited. Most research has been conducted on specific types of MNPs, however, limited scientific information is available on many commonly used environmental MNPs. Future research should investigate the MNP exposure by considering realistic doses, concentration-dependent toxicological effects, and quantification of its harmful outcomes. This necessitates larger sample sizes and robust analytical techniques to completely comprehend the true toxicological consequences of MNPs on human health.},

  abstract = {Plastics are used all over the world. Unfortunately, due to limited biodegradation, plastics cause a significant level of environmental pollution. The smallest recognized to date are termed nanoplastics (1~nm [nm] up to 1~μm [μm]) and microplastics (1~μm–5~mm). These nano- and microplastics can enter the human body through the respiratory system via inhalation, the digestive tract via consumption of contaminated food and water, or penetration through the skin via cosmetics and clothes contact. Bioaccumulation of plastics in the human body can potentially lead to a range of health issues, including respiratory disorders like lung cancer, asthma and hypersensitivity pneumonitis, neurological symptoms such as fatigue and dizziness, inflammatory bowel disease and even disturbances in gut microbiota. Most studies to date have confirmed that nano- and microplastics can induce apoptosis in cells and have genotoxic and cytotoxic effects. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of plastics’ actions may help extrapolate the risks to humans. The article provides a comprehensive review of articles in databases regarding the impact of nano- and microplastics on human health. The review included retrospective studies and case reports of people exposed to nanoplastics and microplastics. This research highlights the need for further research to fully understand the extent of the impact of plastics on human health.},
