  abstract = {The use of nanoparticles as formulation components of topical drug delivery systems for the skin has been widely investigated in the literature. Because of the conflicting conclusions resulting from these studies concerning the ultimate disposition of the nanoparticles employed, the research presented in this paper has been designed to evaluate objectively the fate of such structures when administered to mammalian skin. Confocal microscopy images of skin exposed to nanoparticles have therefore been assessed by quantitative statistical analysis. Sebum on the skin surface was naturally fluorescent and clearly defined the outermost part of the cutaneous barrier. Fluorescent polystyrene nanoparticles applied in aqueous suspension could infiltrate only the stratum disjunctum, i.e., skin layers in the final stages of desquamation. This minimal uptake was independent of contact time (up to 16h) and of nanoparticle size tested (20–200nm). When skin barrier function was modestly compromised, the nanoparticles remained incapable of penetration beyond the most superficial layers, corresponding to a depth of 2–3μm, of the stratum corneum (the outermost, 15–20μm skin layer). Overall, these results demonstrate objectively and semi-quantitatively that nanoparticles contacting intact, and even partially damaged, skin cannot penetrate beyond the superficial layers of the barrier, and are highly unlikely, therefore, to reach the viable cells of the epidermis or beyond. It follows that nanoparticulate-based, topical delivery systems may prove useful as skin surface reservoirs from which controlled drug release over time may be achieved.},

  abstract = {Nanoplastics (NPs) are mainly generated from the decomposition of plastic waste and industrial production, which have attracted much attention due to the potential risk for humans. The ability of NPs to penetrate different biological barriers has been proved, but the understanding of molecular details is very limited, especially for organic pollutant-NP combinations. Here, we investigated the uptake process of polystyrene NPs (PSNPs) combined with benzo(a)pyrene (BAP) molecules by dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayers by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The results showed that the PSNPs can adsorb and accumulate BAP molecules in water phase and then carried BAP molecules to enter DPPC bilayers. At the same time, the adsorbed BAP promoted the penetration of PSNPs into DPPC bilayers effectively by hydrophobic effect. The process of BAP-PSNP combinations penetrating into DPPC bilayers can be summarized into four steps including adhesion on the DPPC bilayer surface, uptake by the DPPC bilayer, BAP molecules detached from the PSNPs, and the PSNPs depolymerized in the bilayer interior. Furthermore, the amount of adsorbed BAP on PSNPs affected the properties of DPPC bilayers directly, especially the fluidity of DPPC bilayers that determine the physiologic function. Obviously, the combined effect of PSNPs and BAP enhanced the cytotoxicity. This work not only presented a vivid transmembrane process of BAP-PSNP combinations and revealed the nature of the effects of adsorbed benzo(a)pyrene on the dynamic behavior of polystyrene nanoplastics through phospholipid membrane, but also provide some necessary information of the potential damage for organic pollutant-nanoplastic combinations on human health at a molecular level.},

  abstract = {Background Frustrated phagocytosis occurs when an asbestos fiber {$>$}\,10\,μm in length is engulfed imperfectly by a macrophage, and it is believed to be associated with chromosomal instability. Few studies have focused on dynamic cellular imaging to assess the toxicity of hazardous inorganic materials such as asbestos. One reason for this is the relative lack of fluorescent probes available to facilitate experimental visualization of inorganic materials. We recently developed asbestos-specific fluorescent probes based on asbestos-binding proteins, and achieved efficient fluorescent labeling of asbestos. Results Live-cell imaging with fluorescent asbestos probes was successfully utilized to dynamically analyze asbestos phagocytosis. The fluorescently labeled asbestos fibers were phagocytosed by RAW 264.7 macrophages. Internalized fibers of {$<$}\,5\,μm in length were visualized clearly via overlaid phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy images, but they were not clearly depicted using phase contrast images alone. Approximately 60\% of the cells had phagocytosed asbestos fibers after 2\,h, but over 96\% of cells remained alive even 24\,h after the addition of asbestos fibers. Immediate cell death was only observed when an asbestos fiber was physically pulled from a cell by an external force. Notably, at 24\,h after the addition of asbestos fibers an approximately 4-fold increase in the number of binucleated cells was observed. Monitoring of individual cell divisions of cells that had phagocytosed asbestos suggested that binucleated cells were formed via the inhibition of cell separation, by asbestos fibers of {$>$}\,10\,μm in length that were localized in the proximity of the intercellular bridge. Conclusions Fluorescently labeled asbestos facilitated visualization of the dynamic biological processes that occur during and after the internalization of asbestos fibers, and indicated that (i) frustrated phagocytosis itself does not lead to immediate cell death unless the asbestos fiber is physically pulled from the cell by an external force, and (ii) macrophages that have phagocytosed asbestos can divide but sometimes the resulting daughter cells fuse, leading to the formation of a binucleated cell. This fusion only seemed to occur when a comparatively long asbestos fiber ({$>$}\,10\,μm) was shared by two daughter cells.

Unfortunately, their break down products pollute our environment, leading to widespread contamination with micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs). The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is an important biological barrier that protects the brain from harmful substances. In our study we performed short term uptake studies in mice with orally administered polystyrene micro-/nanoparticles (9.55 µm, 1.14 µm, 0.293 µm). We show that nanometer sized particles—but not bigger particles—reach the brain within only 2 h after gavage. To understand the transport mechanism, we performed coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations on the interaction of DOPC bilayers with a polystyrene nanoparticle in the presence and absence of various coronae. We found that the composition of the biomolecular corona surrounding the plastic particles was critical for passage through the BBB. Cholesterol molecules enhanced the uptake of these contaminants into the membrane of the BBB, whereas the protein model inhibited it. These opposing effects could explain the passive transport of the particles into the brain.},

  abstract = {Nanoplastics (NPs) are emerging pollutants worldwide. Particularly worrisome is that although studies have reported that NPs can amplify the biotoxicity of environmental pollutants, the specific mechanism remains unclear. Here, we found that NPs, even without significant toxicity (cell survival: 99.11\%), amplified the hepatocyte toxicity of Cd2+. Mechanistically, higher Cd2+ uptake (Δ = 23.80\%) combined with crucial intracellular desorption behavior of Cd2+ loaded in NPs (desorption rate: 82.70\%) were identified as prerequisites for NPs amplifying Cd2+ cytotoxicity. As for toxigenic pathways, the inflammatory response and calcium (Ca) signaling pathway were identified as the primary molecular events leading to the amplification of Cd2+ cytotoxicity. Further phenotypic monitoring revealed that NPs synergized with Cd2+ to induce more severe pyroptosis and apoptosis by activating the inflammatory caspase-1-dependent and Ca2+-mitochondrial-caspase-3 pathways to a greater extent, respectively. This study reveals and proves for the first time the “Trojan horse” effects of NPs, thus elucidating the actual mechanisms by which NPs act as toxicity amplifiers of pollutants, providing significant insights into accurate risk assessment of NPs in composite pollution.}

  abstract = {Micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs), originating from plastic wastes degradation, industrial processes, and textile fiber shedding, persist in the environment and act as carriers of hazardous substances, posing significant global health risks. Growing evidence links MNPs exposure to neurotoxicity; however, substantial knowledge gaps remain regarding their environmental distribution, cellular effects, and epidemiological consequences. This review systematically examines the sources and exposure pathways of MNPs, as well as their potential contribution to neurological disorders. It outlines key neurotoxic effects, including neuronal damage, synaptic dysfunction, blood-brain barrier disruption, neuroinflammation, and protein aggregation, which may contribute to cognitive decline and motor impairments. Additionally, it explores the underlying mechanisms of MNPs-induced toxicity, such as oxidative stress, immune responses, mitochondrial dysfunction, cell death signaling, and the gut-brain axis. Given the complexity of MNPs interactions, the study highlights the need for future research on coexposure effects with other pollutants and their impact on MNPs toxicity. Finally, this article advocates for stricter MNPs pollution control, advancements in detection technologies, and a deeper understanding of neurotoxic mechanisms, emphasizing the necessity of interdisciplinary collaboration to assess and mitigate associated health risks.},

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) of the cerebral vasculature prevents extravasation of blood products into the brain to protect neural tissue and maintain a homeostatic environment. The BBB also functions as part of a neurovascular unit (NVU), which is comprised of neurons, astrocytes, and microglia in addition to the specialized endothelial cells, mural cells, and the basement membrane of the BBB. Through coordinated intercellular signaling, these cells function as a dynamic unit to tightly regulate brain blood flow, vascular function, neuroimmune responses, and waste clearance. In this chapter, we review the functions of individual NVU components, describe neurovascular coupling as a classic example of NVU function, and discuss archetypal NVU pathophysiology during disease.},

Microglia emerge from early erythromyeloid progenitors of the yolk sac and enter the developing brain before the establishment of a fully mature blood–brain barrier. In physiological conditions, during brain development, microglia contribute to CNS homeostasis by supporting cell proliferation of neural precursors. In post-natal life, such cells contribute to preserving the integrity of neuronal circuits by sculpting synapses. After a CNS injury, microglia change their morphology and down-regulate those genes supporting homeostatic functions. However, it is still unclear whether such changes are accompanied by molecular and functional modifications that might contribute to the pathological process. While comprehensive transcriptome analyses at the single-cell level have identified specific gene perturbations occurring in the “pathological” microglia, still the precise protective/detrimental role of microglia in neurological disorders is far from being fully elucidated. In this review, the results so far obtained regarding the role of microglia in neurodegenerative disorders will be discussed. There is solid and sound evidence suggesting that regulating microglia functions during disease pathology might represent a strategy to develop future therapies aimed at counteracting brain degeneration in multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.},

This review provides comprehensive and updated scientific information on how MNPs enter the human body through multiple routes such as inhalation, ingestion, and dermal contact, and circulate through the bloodstream to get deposited in various organs. Its focus revolves around the toxicological effects caused by MNPs on human health, specifically on vital organ systems such as the respiratory, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, nervous, immune, reproductive, endocrine, and urinary systems. Important findings indicate that MNP exposure may result in oxidative stress (OS), inflammation, impaired biochemical and energy metabolism, altered morphology and proliferation, diminished cellular metabolic activity, immune dysfunction, cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, disrupted microbial metabolic pathways, developmental abnormalities, and carcinogenicity. The toxicological effects of MNPs depend upon many factors such as their size, type, concentration, and charge. The review has also highlighted the knowledge gaps in current research. Despite evidence from cellular and animal studies, human studies on the toxic effects of MNPs are limited. Most research has been conducted on specific types of MNPs, however, limited scientific information is available on many commonly used environmental MNPs. Future research should investigate the MNP exposure by considering realistic doses, concentration-dependent toxicological effects, and quantification of its harmful outcomes. This necessitates larger sample sizes and robust analytical techniques to completely comprehend the true toxicological consequences of MNPs on human health.},

Recent in vivo imaging studies have revealed that in the resting healthy brain, microglia are highly dynamic, moving constantly to actively survey the brain parenchyma. These active microglia can rapidly respond to pathological insults, becoming activated to induce a range of effects that may contribute to both pathogenesis, or to confer neuronal protection. However, interactions between microglia and neurons are being recognized as important in shaping neural circuit activity under more normal, physiological conditions. During development and neurogenesis, microglia interactions with neurons help to shape the final patterns of neural circuits important for behavior and with implications for diseases. In the mature brain, microglia can respond to changes in sensory activity and can influence neuronal activity acutely and over the long term. Microglia seem to be particularly involved in monitoring the integrity of synaptic function.

These nano- and microplastics can enter the human body through the respiratory system via inhalation, the digestive tract via consumption of contaminated food and water, or penetration through the skin via cosmetics and clothes contact. Bioaccumulation of plastics in the human body can potentially lead to a range of health issues, including respiratory disorders like lung cancer, asthma and hypersensitivity pneumonitis, neurological symptoms such as fatigue and dizziness, inflammatory bowel disease and even disturbances in gut microbiota. Most studies to date have confirmed that nano- and microplastics can induce apoptosis in cells and have genotoxic and cytotoxic effects. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of plastics’ actions may help extrapolate the risks to humans. The article provides a comprehensive review of articles in databases regarding the impact of nano- and microplastics on human health. The review included retrospective studies and case reports of people exposed to nanoplastics and microplastics. This research highlights the need for further research to fully understand the extent of the impact of plastics on human health.},

  abstract = {The central nervous system (CNS) historically has been considered an immune-privileged organ, lacking a lymphatic system and shielded from the circulatory system by the blood-brain barrier. Microglia are an abundant portion of the CNS cell population, comprising 5\% to 20\% of the total glial cell population, and are as numerous as neurons. A crucial function of microglia is the ability to generate significant innate and adaptive immune responses. Microglia are involved in first line innate immunity of the CNS. Proper antigen presentation is critical in the generation of specific, durable responses by the adaptive immune system, and requires interaction between the T cell receptor and processed antigen peptide presented on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules by the antigen presenting cells. Microglia also have a large regulatory role in CNS immunity. Histopathologic studies of glioma tissue have consistently shown high levels of infiltrating microglia. Microglia are also localized diffusely throughout the tumor, rather than to the areas of necrosis, and phagocytosis of glioma cells or debris by microglia is not observed. Recent evidence indicates that glioma-infiltrating microglia/macrophages might be promoting tumor growth by facilitating immunosuppression of the tumor microenvironment. When activated, microglia can be potent immune effector cells, able to perform a broad range of functions, and they mediate both innate and adaptive responses during CNS injury and disease while remaining quiescent in the steady state. Their versatility in bridging the gap between the immune-privileged CNS and the peripheral immune system, in addition to their significant numbers in gliomas, makes them an attractive candidate in immunotherapy for gliomas. An enhanced understanding of microglia–glioma interaction can provide better methods to manipulate the glioma microenvironment to allow the generation of a specific and durable anti-glioma immunity. The role of microglia in CNS immunity is discussed, with a focus on key advances made in glioma immunology.},

  abstract = {Microplastics (MPs) are widespread in the environment and can be ingested through food, water, and air, posing a threat to human health. In addition, MPs can have a potential combined effect with other toxic compounds. Polystyrene (PS) has been shown to enhance the cytotoxicity of okadaic acid (OA). However, it remains unclear whether this enhancement effect is related to the size of PS particles. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of the combined effect of PS microplastics (PS-MPs) or PS nanoplastics (PS-NPs) and OA on Caco-2 cells. The results indicated that PS-NPs enhanced the cytotoxicity of OA and induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated apoptosis in Caco-2 cells, compared to PS-MPs. Specifically, PS-NPs and OA cause more severe oxidative stress, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Furthermore, it induced intracellular calcium overload through store-operated channels (SOCs) and activated the PERK/ATF-4/CHOP pathway to cause ER stress. ER stress promoted mitochondrial damage and finally activated the caspase family to induce apoptosis. This study provided an indirect basis for the assessment of the combined toxicity of MPs or NPs with OA.},
