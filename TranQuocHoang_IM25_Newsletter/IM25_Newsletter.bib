  abstract = {The hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) and gut-brain axes are vital biological pathways in depression. The HPA axis regulates the body's stress response, and chronic stress can lead to overactivation of the HPA axis, resulting in elevated cortisol levels that contribute to neuronal damage, particularly in regions such as the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, both of which are involved in mood regulation and mental disorders. In parallel, the gut-brain axis, a bidirectional communication network between the gut microbiota and the central nervous system, influences emotional and cognitive functions. Imbalances in gut microbiota can affect the HPA axis, promoting inflammation and increasing gut permeability. This allows endotoxins to enter the bloodstream, contributing to neuroinflammation and altering neurotransmitter production, including serotonin. Since the majority of serotonin is produced in the gut, disruptions in this pathway may be linked to depressive symptoms. This review explores the interplay between the HPA axis and the gut-brain axis in the context of depression.},

  abstract = {Psychological stress can precipitate depression, and emerging preclinical data suggest a link between stress-induced alterations in microglia function and development of depressive-like behaviors. Microglia are highly dynamic, and play an integral role in maintaining neuronal homeostasis and synaptic plasticity. In this capacity, microglial dysfunction represents a compelling avenue through which stress might disrupt neuronal integrity and induce psychopathology. This review examines preclinical and clinical postmortem findings that indicate microglia-neuron interactions contribute to stress-induced synaptic deficits and associated behavioral and cognitive consequences. We focus on pathways that are implicated in microglia-mediated neuronal remodeling, including CSF1-CSF1R, CX3CL1-CX3CR1, and CD11b (CR3)-C3, as well as purinergic signaling via P2RX7 and P2RY12. We also highlight sex differences in stress effects on microglia, and the potential for microglia in the development of sex-specific treatments for depressive disorders.},

  abstract = {Microplastics (MPs), defined as plastic particles smaller than 5 mm, are increasingly recognized as environmental contaminants with potential health risks. These emerge as breakdown products of larger plastics and are omnipresent in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems. They are primarily composed of polymers such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, and additives that enhance their performance. MPs also adsorb harmful environmental chemicals like persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals, posing risks to human and environmental health. Human exposure to MPs occurs mainly through ingestion and inhalation, with MPs detected in food products, water, and even the air. MPs have been shown to accumulate in the gastrointestinal tract, disrupting the gut microbiome, and causing dysbiosis-a harmful imbalance between beneficial and harmful bacteria. This disruption has been linked to various health issues, including gastrointestinal disorders, systemic inflammation, and chronic diseases. Furthermore, the gut-brain axis may be affected, with potential neuroinflammatory consequences. As research continues to unravel the health impacts of MP exposure, understanding the mechanisms of accumulation and the broader implications on human health is crucial. This review highlights the effects of MPs on human health, emphasizing their impact on the gut microbiome. We discuss the potential connections between MP exposure and cardiometabolic and inflammatory diseases, and disorders related to the Gut-Brain Axis. By synthesizing the latest research, this work sheds light on the silent yet pervasive threat posed by MPs and underscores the importance of further studies to understand their health impacts fully.},

  abstract = {The use of nanoparticles as formulation components of topical drug delivery systems for the skin has been widely investigated in the literature. Because of the conflicting conclusions resulting from these studies concerning the ultimate disposition of the nanoparticles employed, the research presented in this paper has been designed to evaluate objectively the fate of such structures when administered to mammalian skin. Confocal microscopy images of skin exposed to nanoparticles have therefore been assessed by quantitative statistical analysis. Sebum on the skin surface was naturally fluorescent and clearly defined the outermost part of the cutaneous barrier. Fluorescent polystyrene nanoparticles applied in aqueous suspension could infiltrate only the stratum disjunctum, i.e., skin layers in the final stages of desquamation. This minimal uptake was independent of contact time (up to 16h) and of nanoparticle size tested (20–200nm). When skin barrier function was modestly compromised, the nanoparticles remained incapable of penetration beyond the most superficial layers, corresponding to a depth of 2–3μm, of the stratum corneum (the outermost, 15–20μm skin layer). Overall, these results demonstrate objectively and semi-quantitatively that nanoparticles contacting intact, and even partially damaged, skin cannot penetrate beyond the superficial layers of the barrier, and are highly unlikely, therefore, to reach the viable cells of the epidermis or beyond. It follows that nanoparticulate-based, topical delivery systems may prove useful as skin surface reservoirs from which controlled drug release over time may be achieved.},

  abstract = {Chronic pain frequently coexists with adverse emotions, including anxiety and depression, significantly affecting patients’ physical and psychological health as well as their quality of life. Changes in hippocampal synaptic architecture, neuronal injury, and diminished neurogenesis significantly contribute to pain-related emotions. Microglia in the hippocampus are implicated in these pathologies. Stimulation or injury leads to microglial activation, which causes pain; prolonged pain causes microglia to continuously release pro-inflammatory factors that induce astrocyte activation, which mediates the apoptosis of hippocampal neurons and abnormal neurogenesis. Concurrently, microglia exhibit aberrant phagocytosis and augmented pruning of hippocampal dendritic spines, which disrupts synaptic plasticity and influences hippocampal long-term potentiation, hence contributing to the emergence of negative emotions. Inflammatory responses in the brain are a prevalent pathological foundation for mood disorders and pain, and the activation or inhibition of microglia M1 polarization can influence pain-related emotions. This review elucidates the significance of hippocampal microglia activation, and their interactions with neurons in the hippocampus and astrocytes, in pain-related emotions.},

  abstract = {Nanoplastics (NPs) are mainly generated from the decomposition of plastic waste and industrial production, which have attracted much attention due to the potential risk for humans. The ability of NPs to penetrate different biological barriers has been proved, but the understanding of molecular details is very limited, especially for organic pollutant-NP combinations. Here, we investigated the uptake process of polystyrene NPs (PSNPs) combined with benzo(a)pyrene (BAP) molecules by dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayers by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The results showed that the PSNPs can adsorb and accumulate BAP molecules in water phase and then carried BAP molecules to enter DPPC bilayers. At the same time, the adsorbed BAP promoted the penetration of PSNPs into DPPC bilayers effectively by hydrophobic effect. The process of BAP-PSNP combinations penetrating into DPPC bilayers can be summarized into four steps including adhesion on the DPPC bilayer surface, uptake by the DPPC bilayer, BAP molecules detached from the PSNPs, and the PSNPs depolymerized in the bilayer interior. Furthermore, the amount of adsorbed BAP on PSNPs affected the properties of DPPC bilayers directly, especially the fluidity of DPPC bilayers that determine the physiologic function. Obviously, the combined effect of PSNPs and BAP enhanced the cytotoxicity. This work not only presented a vivid transmembrane process of BAP-PSNP combinations and revealed the nature of the effects of adsorbed benzo(a)pyrene on the dynamic behavior of polystyrene nanoplastics through phospholipid membrane, but also provide some necessary information of the potential damage for organic pollutant-nanoplastic combinations on human health at a molecular level.},

  abstract = {Microglia are the resident macrophages of the central nervous system. Microglia possess varied morphologies and functions. Under normal physiological conditions, microglia mainly exist in a resting state and constantly monitor their microenvironment and survey neuronal and synaptic activity. Through the C1q, C3 and CR3 “Eat Me” and CD47 and SIRPα “Don’t Eat Me” complement pathways, as well as other pathways such as CX3CR1 signaling, resting microglia regulate synaptic pruning, a process crucial for the promotion of synapse formation and the regulation of neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity. By mediating synaptic pruning, resting microglia play an important role in the regulation of experience-dependent plasticity in the barrel cortex and visual cortex after whisker removal or monocular deprivation, and also in the regulation of learning and memory, including the modulation of memory strength, forgetfulness, and memory quality. As a response to brain injury, infection or neuroinflammation, microglia become activated and increase in number. Activated microglia change to an amoeboid shape, migrate to sites of inflammation and secrete proteins such as cytokines, chemokines and reactive oxygen species. These molecules released by microglia can lead to synaptic plasticity and learning and memory deficits associated with aging, Alzheimer’s disease, traumatic brain injury, HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder, and other neurological or mental disorders such as autism, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. With a focus mainly on recently published literature, here we reviewed the studies investigating the role of resting microglia in synaptic plasticity and learning and memory, as well as how activated microglia modulate disease-related plasticity and learning and memory deficits. By summarizing the function of microglia in these processes, we aim to provide an overview of microglia regulation of synaptic plasticity and learning and memory, and to discuss the possibility of microglia manipulation as a therapeutic to ameliorate cognitive deficits associated with aging, Alzheimer’s disease, traumatic brain injury, HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder, and mental disorders.},

They areusually of odontogenic origin, but maxillofacial swelling could also have non-odontogenic causes. Their clinical presentation is worrisome for the patient, presenting as swellings of the region with rapid and significant expansion to adjacent areas due to the thin and delicate nature of the regional soft tissues. Materials and methods The characteristic features are discussed upon the presentation of a case series of the most common types of inflammation seen in the region. Results In most hospital emergency departments, ultrasound scanning is readily accessible, and typically constitutes the first-line imaging modality for this entity. Nevertheless, the role of ultrasound imaging is limited in cases with deep extension of the inflammation, where cross-sectional imaging with CT or MRI will be the modality of choice. This manuscript aims to present the characteristic features of various inflammatory conditions of the maxillofacial area seen on ultrasonography. Conclusions Even though maxillofacial inflammations are often treated without imaging in their initial phase, ultrasound can provide aninexpensive, easy-to-use, and readily available alternative that best visualizes the characteristics and expansion patterns of the lesions, based on their origin and area of initial presentation.},

  abstract = {Adult hippocampal neurogenesis generates functional neurons from neural progenitor cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) to complement and repair neurons and neural circuits, thus benefiting the treatment of depression. Increasing evidence has shown that aberrant microglial activity can disrupt the appropriate formation and development of functional properties of neurogenesis, which will play a crucial role in the occurrence and development of depression. However, the mechanisms of the crosstalk between microglia and adult hippocampal neurogenesis in depression are not yet fully understood. Therefore, in this review, we first introduce recent discoveries regarding the roles of microglia and adult hippocampal neurogenesis in the etiology of depression. Then, we systematically discuss the possible mechanisms of how microglia regulate adult hippocampal neurogenesis in depression according to recent studies, which involve toll-like receptors, microglial polarization, fractalkine-C-X3-C motif chemokine receptor 1, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, cytokines, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and the microbiota-gut-brain axis, etc. In addition, we summarize the promising drugs that could improve the adult hippocampal neurogenesis by regulating the microglia. These findings will help us understand the complicated pathological mechanisms of depression and shed light on the development of new treatment strategies for this disease.},

We systematically reviewed animal experiments related to the effects of systemic inflammation on the microglial and inflammatory response in the brain. Methods We searched PubMed between January 1, 1950 and December 1, 2013 and Embase between January 1, 1988 and December 1, 2013 for animal studies on the influence of peripheral inflammatory stimuli on microglia and the brain. Identified studies were systematically scored on methodological quality. Two investigators extracted independently data on animal species, gender, age, and genetic background; number of animals; infectious stimulus; microglial cells; and other inflammatory parameters in the brain, including methods, time points after inoculation, and brain regions. Results Fifty-one studies were identified of which the majority was performed in mice (n = 30) or in rats (n = 19). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (dose ranging between 0.33 and 200 mg/kg) was used as a peripheral infectious stimulus in 39 studies (76 \%), and live or heat-killed pathogens were used in 12 studies (24 \%). Information about animal characteristics such as species, strain, sex, age, and weight were defined in 41 studies (80 \%), and complete methods of the disease model were described in 35 studies (68 \%). Studies were also heterogeneous with respect to methods used to assess microglial activation; markers used mostly were the ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule-1 (Iba-1), cluster of differentiation 68 (CD68), and CD11b. After LPS challenge microglial activation was seen 6 h after challenge and remained present for at least 3 days. Live Escherichia coli resulted in microglial activation after 2 days, and heat-killed bacteria after 2 weeks. Concomitant with microglial response, inflammatory parameters in the brain were reviewed in 23 of 51 studies (45 \%). Microglial activation was associated with an increase in Toll-like receptor (TLR-2 and TLR-4), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression or protein levels. Interpretation Animal experiments robustly showed that peripheral inflammatory stimuli cause microglial activation. We observed distinct differences in microglial activation between systemic stimulation with (supranatural doses) LPS and live or heat-killed bacteria.},

  abstract = {Background Frustrated phagocytosis occurs when an asbestos fiber {$>$}\,10\,μm in length is engulfed imperfectly by a macrophage, and it is believed to be associated with chromosomal instability. Few studies have focused on dynamic cellular imaging to assess the toxicity of hazardous inorganic materials such as asbestos. One reason for this is the relative lack of fluorescent probes available to facilitate experimental visualization of inorganic materials. We recently developed asbestos-specific fluorescent probes based on asbestos-binding proteins, and achieved efficient fluorescent labeling of asbestos. Results Live-cell imaging with fluorescent asbestos probes was successfully utilized to dynamically analyze asbestos phagocytosis. The fluorescently labeled asbestos fibers were phagocytosed by RAW 264.7 macrophages. Internalized fibers of {$<$}\,5\,μm in length were visualized clearly via overlaid phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy images, but they were not clearly depicted using phase contrast images alone. Approximately 60\% of the cells had phagocytosed asbestos fibers after 2\,h, but over 96\% of cells remained alive even 24\,h after the addition of asbestos fibers. Immediate cell death was only observed when an asbestos fiber was physically pulled from a cell by an external force. Notably, at 24\,h after the addition of asbestos fibers an approximately 4-fold increase in the number of binucleated cells was observed. Monitoring of individual cell divisions of cells that had phagocytosed asbestos suggested that binucleated cells were formed via the inhibition of cell separation, by asbestos fibers of {$>$}\,10\,μm in length that were localized in the proximity of the intercellular bridge. Conclusions Fluorescently labeled asbestos facilitated visualization of the dynamic biological processes that occur during and after the internalization of asbestos fibers, and indicated that (i) frustrated phagocytosis itself does not lead to immediate cell death unless the asbestos fiber is physically pulled from the cell by an external force, and (ii) macrophages that have phagocytosed asbestos can divide but sometimes the resulting daughter cells fuse, leading to the formation of a binucleated cell. This fusion only seemed to occur when a comparatively long asbestos fiber ({$>$}\,10\,μm) was shared by two daughter cells.

  abstract = {Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a cell-wall immunostimulatory endotoxin component of Gram-negative bacteria. A growing body of evidence reveals that alterations in the bacterial composition of the intestinal microbiota (gut dysbiosis) disrupt host immune homeostasis and the intestinal barrier function. Microbial dysbiosis leads to a proinflammatory milieu and systemic endotoxemia, which contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases and metabolic disorders. Two important pathophysiological hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are oxidative/nitrative stress and inflammation, which can be initiated by elevated intestinal permeability, with increased abundance of pathobionts. These changes lead to excessive release of LPS and other bacterial products into blood, which in turn induce chronic systemic inflammation, which damages the blood–brain barrier (BBB). An impaired BBB allows the translocation of potentially harmful bacterial products, including LPS, and activated neutrophils/leucocytes into the brain, which results in neuroinflammation and apoptosis. Chronic neuroinflammation causes neuronal damage and synaptic loss, leading to memory impairment. LPS-induced inflammation causes inappropriate activation of microglia, astrocytes, and dendritic cells. Consequently, these alterations negatively affect mitochondrial function and lead to increases in oxidative/nitrative stress and neuronal senescence. These cellular changes in the brain give rise to specific clinical symptoms, such as impairment of locomotor function, muscle weakness, paralysis, learning deficits, and dementia. This review summarizes the contributing role of LPS in the development of neuroinflammation and neuronal cell death in various neurodegenerative diseases.},

Unfortunately, their break down products pollute our environment, leading to widespread contamination with micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs). The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is an important biological barrier that protects the brain from harmful substances. In our study we performed short term uptake studies in mice with orally administered polystyrene micro-/nanoparticles (9.55 µm, 1.14 µm, 0.293 µm). We show that nanometer sized particles—but not bigger particles—reach the brain within only 2 h after gavage. To understand the transport mechanism, we performed coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations on the interaction of DOPC bilayers with a polystyrene nanoparticle in the presence and absence of various coronae. We found that the composition of the biomolecular corona surrounding the plastic particles was critical for passage through the BBB. Cholesterol molecules enhanced the uptake of these contaminants into the membrane of the BBB, whereas the protein model inhibited it. These opposing effects could explain the passive transport of the particles into the brain.},

  abstract = {Nanoplastics (NPs) are emerging pollutants worldwide. Particularly worrisome is that although studies have reported that NPs can amplify the biotoxicity of environmental pollutants, the specific mechanism remains unclear. Here, we found that NPs, even without significant toxicity (cell survival: 99.11\%), amplified the hepatocyte toxicity of Cd2+. Mechanistically, higher Cd2+ uptake (Δ = 23.80\%) combined with crucial intracellular desorption behavior of Cd2+ loaded in NPs (desorption rate: 82.70\%) were identified as prerequisites for NPs amplifying Cd2+ cytotoxicity. As for toxigenic pathways, the inflammatory response and calcium (Ca) signaling pathway were identified as the primary molecular events leading to the amplification of Cd2+ cytotoxicity. Further phenotypic monitoring revealed that NPs synergized with Cd2+ to induce more severe pyroptosis and apoptosis by activating the inflammatory caspase-1-dependent and Ca2+-mitochondrial-caspase-3 pathways to a greater extent, respectively. This study reveals and proves for the first time the “Trojan horse” effects of NPs, thus elucidating the actual mechanisms by which NPs act as toxicity amplifiers of pollutants, providing significant insights into accurate risk assessment of NPs in composite pollution.}

Growing evidence links MNPs exposure to neurotoxicity; however, substantial knowledge gaps remain regarding their environmental distribution, cellular effects, and epidemiological consequences. This review systematically examines the sources and exposure pathways of MNPs, as well as their potential contribution to neurological disorders. It outlines key neurotoxic effects, including neuronal damage, synaptic dysfunction, blood-brain barrier disruption, neuroinflammation, and protein aggregation, which may contribute to cognitive decline and motor impairments. Additionally, it explores the underlying mechanisms of MNPs-induced toxicity, such as oxidative stress, immune responses, mitochondrial dysfunction, cell death signaling, and the gut-brain axis. Given the complexity of MNPs interactions, the study highlights the need for future research on coexposure effects with other pollutants and their impact on MNPs toxicity. Finally, this article advocates for stricter MNPs pollution control, advancements in detection technologies, and a deeper understanding of neurotoxic mechanisms, emphasizing the necessity of interdisciplinary collaboration to assess and mitigate associated health risks.},

  abstract = {Neuroinflammation is a local tissue response to injurious stimuli in the central nervous system (CNS) and is characterized by glial reactivity, induction of cytokines and chemokines, and vascular permeability. The cytokine interleukin (IL)-1β is rapidly induced following CNS insult, and is chronically expressed in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We recently developed a novel method of sustained IL-1β production in the brain to study the link between IL-1β and AD pathogenesis. Utilizing this model, we have previously demonstrated reduction of plaque size and frequency accompanied by a robust neuroinflammatory response. These observations were limited to a single early time point in the course of AD plaque deposition and did not investigate other neurodegenerative endpoints. To extend these observations to other stages of disease progression and evaluate additional pathologic markers, we investigated the effects of age and duration of IL-1β overexpression in the APPswe/PS-1dE9 AD model on a congenic C57BL/6 background. We now report that IL1β overexpression leads to decreased 6E10 immunopositive plaque pathology regardless of age or duration. We also investigated whether IL-1β overexpression led to neuronal apoptosis or cholinergic axonal degeneration in the context of this AD model. Although we could demonstrate apoptosis of infiltrating inflammatory cells, we found no evidence for IL-1 associated apoptosis of neurons or cholinergic axon degeneration even after five months of chronic neuroinflammation. Together, these observations point to a neuroprotective role for IL-1β in AD neuropathogenesis.},

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) of the cerebral vasculature prevents extravasation of blood products into the brain to protect neural tissue and maintain a homeostatic environment. The BBB also functions as part of a neurovascular unit (NVU), which is comprised of neurons, astrocytes, and microglia in addition to the specialized endothelial cells, mural cells, and the basement membrane of the BBB. Through coordinated intercellular signaling, these cells function as a dynamic unit to tightly regulate brain blood flow, vascular function, neuroimmune responses, and waste clearance. In this chapter, we review the functions of individual NVU components, describe neurovascular coupling as a classic example of NVU function, and discuss archetypal NVU pathophysiology during disease.},

Microglia emerge from early erythromyeloid progenitors of the yolk sac and enter the developing brain before the establishment of a fully mature blood–brain barrier. In physiological conditions, during brain development, microglia contribute to CNS homeostasis by supporting cell proliferation of neural precursors. In post-natal life, such cells contribute to preserving the integrity of neuronal circuits by sculpting synapses. After a CNS injury, microglia change their morphology and down-regulate those genes supporting homeostatic functions. However, it is still unclear whether such changes are accompanied by molecular and functional modifications that might contribute to the pathological process. While comprehensive transcriptome analyses at the single-cell level have identified specific gene perturbations occurring in the “pathological” microglia, still the precise protective/detrimental role of microglia in neurological disorders is far from being fully elucidated. In this review, the results so far obtained regarding the role of microglia in neurodegenerative disorders will be discussed. There is solid and sound evidence suggesting that regulating microglia functions during disease pathology might represent a strategy to develop future therapies aimed at counteracting brain degeneration in multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.},

  abstract = {Autoimmune diseases are chronic inflammatory conditions characterized by the breakdown of immune tolerance to self-antigens. While genetic and environmental factors play key roles, growing evidence highlights chronic stress as a significant contributor to immune dysregulation through its impact on the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. The HPA axis, primarily via cortisol secretion, serves as the major neuroendocrine mediator of stress responses, influencing both immune regulation and systemic homeostasis. This review synthesizes current literature on HPA axis physiology, the mechanisms of cortisol signaling, and the maladaptive effects of chronic stress. Emphasis is placed on clinical and experimental findings linking HPA dysfunction to immune imbalance and autoimmunity, as well as organ-specific consequences across neuroimmune, endocrine, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, integumentary, and musculoskeletal systems. Chronic stress leads to impaired HPA axis feedback, glucocorticoid receptor resistance, and paradoxical cortisol dysregulation, fostering a pro-inflammatory state. This dysregulation promotes cytokine imbalance, weakens protective immune mechanisms, and shifts the immune response toward autoimmunity. Evidence from both human and animal studies associates persistent HPA dysfunction with diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis. HPA axis dysregulation under chronic stress constitutes a critical mechanistic link between psychological stress and autoimmune disease. Understanding these pathways provides opportunities for therapeutic interventions, including stress management, lifestyle modification, and neuroendocrine-targeted treatments. Future research should focus on multi-omics and longitudinal approaches to clarify the reversibility of HPA alterations and identify resilience factors.},

Its focus revolves around the toxicological effects caused by MNPs on human health, specifically on vital organ systems such as the respiratory, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, nervous, immune, reproductive, endocrine, and urinary systems. Important findings indicate that MNP exposure may result in oxidative stress (OS), inflammation, impaired biochemical and energy metabolism, altered morphology and proliferation, diminished cellular metabolic activity, immune dysfunction, cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, disrupted microbial metabolic pathways, developmental abnormalities, and carcinogenicity. The toxicological effects of MNPs depend upon many factors such as their size, type, concentration, and charge. The review has also highlighted the knowledge gaps in current research. Despite evidence from cellular and animal studies, human studies on the toxic effects of MNPs are limited. Most research has been conducted on specific types of MNPs, however, limited scientific information is available on many commonly used environmental MNPs. Future research should investigate the MNP exposure by considering realistic doses, concentration-dependent toxicological effects, and quantification of its harmful outcomes. This necessitates larger sample sizes and robust analytical techniques to completely comprehend the true toxicological consequences of MNPs on human health.},

Recent in vivo imaging studies have revealed that in the resting healthy brain, microglia are highly dynamic, moving constantly to actively survey the brain parenchyma. These active microglia can rapidly respond to pathological insults, becoming activated to induce a range of effects that may contribute to both pathogenesis, or to confer neuronal protection. However, interactions between microglia and neurons are being recognized as important in shaping neural circuit activity under more normal, physiological conditions. During development and neurogenesis, microglia interactions with neurons help to shape the final patterns of neural circuits important for behavior and with implications for diseases. In the mature brain, microglia can respond to changes in sensory activity and can influence neuronal activity acutely and over the long term. Microglia seem to be particularly involved in monitoring the integrity of synaptic function. In this review, we discuss some of these new insights into the involvement of microglia in neural circuits.},

Most studies to date have confirmed that nano- and microplastics can induce apoptosis in cells and have genotoxic and cytotoxic effects. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of plastics’ actions may help extrapolate the risks to humans. The article provides a comprehensive review of articles in databases regarding the impact of nano- and microplastics on human health. The review included retrospective studies and case reports of people exposed to nanoplastics and microplastics. This research highlights the need for further research to fully understand the extent of the impact of plastics on human health.},

  abstract = {The central nervous system (CNS) historically has been considered an immune-privileged organ, lacking a lymphatic system and shielded from the circulatory system by the blood-brain barrier. Microglia are an abundant portion of the CNS cell population, comprising 5\% to 20\% of the total glial cell population, and are as numerous as neurons. A crucial function of microglia is the ability to generate significant innate and adaptive immune responses. Microglia are involved in first line innate immunity of the CNS. Proper antigen presentation is critical in the generation of specific, durable responses by the adaptive immune system, and requires interaction between the T cell receptor and processed antigen peptide presented on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules by the antigen presenting cells. Microglia also have a large regulatory role in CNS immunity. Histopathologic studies of glioma tissue have consistently shown high levels of infiltrating microglia. Microglia are also localized diffusely throughout the tumor, rather than to the areas of necrosis, and phagocytosis of glioma cells or debris by microglia is not observed. Recent evidence indicates that glioma-infiltrating microglia/macrophages might be promoting tumor growth by facilitating immunosuppression of the tumor microenvironment. When activated, microglia can be potent immune effector cells, able to perform a broad range of functions, and they mediate both innate and adaptive responses during CNS injury and disease while remaining quiescent in the steady state. Their versatility in bridging the gap between the immune-privileged CNS and the peripheral immune system, in addition to their significant numbers in gliomas, makes them an attractive candidate in immunotherapy for gliomas. An enhanced understanding of microglia–glioma interaction can provide better methods to manipulate the glioma microenvironment to allow the generation of a specific and durable anti-glioma immunity. The role of microglia in CNS immunity is discussed, with a focus on key advances made in glioma immunology.},

  abstract = {Microplastics (MPs) are widespread in the environment and can be ingested through food, water, and air, posing a threat to human health. In addition, MPs can have a potential combined effect with other toxic compounds. Polystyrene (PS) has been shown to enhance the cytotoxicity of okadaic acid (OA). However, it remains unclear whether this enhancement effect is related to the size of PS particles. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of the combined effect of PS microplastics (PS-MPs) or PS nanoplastics (PS-NPs) and OA on Caco-2 cells. The results indicated that PS-NPs enhanced the cytotoxicity of OA and induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated apoptosis in Caco-2 cells, compared to PS-MPs. Specifically, PS-NPs and OA cause more severe oxidative stress, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Furthermore, it induced intracellular calcium overload through store-operated channels (SOCs) and activated the PERK/ATF-4/CHOP pathway to cause ER stress. ER stress promoted mitochondrial damage and finally activated the caspase family to induce apoptosis. This study provided an indirect basis for the assessment of the combined toxicity of MPs or NPs with OA.},
