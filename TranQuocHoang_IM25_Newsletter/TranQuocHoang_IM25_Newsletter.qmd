Current Chosen Topic: Microplastics and Neuro-Immune Axis Disruption.  

Research Question: How do Nanoplastics (NPs) disrupt the Neuro-Immune Axis in the Central Nervous System, specifically by mediating Blood-Brain Barrier permeation and triggering chronic Microglial activation?

# Introduction

First named by [@thompsonLostSeaWhere2004], microplastics are defined as particles with diameters from $\textrm{1}\ \mu \text{m}$ to $\textrm{5}\ \text{mm}$, while nanoplastics have diameters smaller than $\textrm{1}\ \mu \text{m}$.

## Routes of Entry

Micro- and nanoplastics (MPs/NPs) enter the body via several primary routes of entry. The most prevalent pathways are ingestion—mainly from contaminated food and drinking water, which are almost everywhere in modern times—and inhalation—often from airborne particles such as indoor dust and synthetic clothing fibers. While dermal absorption remains a possibility, it is generally considered a less significant route. @fig-entry-routes depicts in detail how MNPs travel to the brain from outside. Recent research discovered that nanoplastics appear to be the most dangerous in terms of systemic effects, as their diminutive size facilitates rapid entrance into the bloodstream and distribution throughout the body [@kopatzMicroNanoplasticsBreach2023].

The American Plastics Industry Association created the SPI code (SPI-Code) to provide a standard method for classifying plastics. Nanoplastics are best at traversing through the BBB into the brain due to their diminutive size. Reprinted from Ma, Q., Lei, J., Pang, Y., Shen, Y., & Zhang, T. (2025).

## Blood-Brain Barrier Structure

The central nervous system has a sophisticated shield called the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) that separates brain matter from the rest of the body. This structure is formed by specialized cerebral endothelial cells connected by tight junctions, along with pericytes and astrocytes [@mcconnellCellsBloodbrainBarrier2022]. The BBB effectively limits the passage of foreign substances, pathogens, and large molecules from the circulatory system past the outer brain layer, which helps maintain the neural microenvironment's homeostasis.
