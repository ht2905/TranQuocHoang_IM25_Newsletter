Current Chosen Topic: The Immunological Effects of Microplastics.
Focus: How the chronic ingestion or inhalation of microplastics (Mikroplastik)—a ubiquitous environmental pollutant—affects gut immunity (Darmimmunität) and systemic inflammatory responses.

Research Question: What specific pharmacological or therapeutic interventions are currently being researched to reverse or mitigate microplastic-induced chronic inflammation within the human gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT)?
