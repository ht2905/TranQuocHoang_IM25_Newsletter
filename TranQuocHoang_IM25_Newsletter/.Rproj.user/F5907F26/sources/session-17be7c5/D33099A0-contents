Current Chosen Topic: Microplastics and Neuro-Immune Axis Disruption.  

Research Question: How do Nanoplastics (NPs) disrupt the Neuro-Immune Axis in the Central Nervous System, specifically by mediating Blood-Brain Barrier permeation and triggering chronic Microglial activation?

This is illustrated well by @fig-entry-routes

## Routes of Entry

# Microglial Activation and Neuroinflammation

# Consequences and Future Directions
