## General Notes
-  **Four-to-eight cell stage** in humans (Day 3-4): Zygotic Gene Activation (`ZGA`): becomes capable of transcription/translation  
	- **Elaboration:** `ZGA (Zygote Genaktivierung)` is a crucial transition where the **zygote** (**Zygote**) switches from using **maternal** (**maternale**) `mRNA` and proteins (stored in the egg cytoplasm) to transcribing and translating its own **embryonic** (**embryonalen**) genome.  
- In first 4 days, cytoplasm needs to mature to accumulate `mRNAs` and proteins 
- Only 60%-80% of human embryos can reach `ZGA`. Reaching successful `ZGA` is a significant **developmental checkpoint**.  
- Inhibit Microtubules: stops cell at Metaphase by preventing **polymerization of spindle**  
- `Cytochalasin B (CB)` Inhibits Microfilaments: prevents cytokinesis, therefore duplicating chromosomes -> proceeds to S phase #chemical 
- `E-Cadherin` causes **compaction** #chemical
- `Cdks` only detectable in Metaphase (because most functional assays detect only active `CDK complexes`)  
- `Cyclin` and `cdks` are boune together by the end of G2 #mpf  
	- **Elaboration:** Specifically, `Mitotic Cyclin (Cyclin B)` begins to accumulate during S and G2 phases. By the end of **G2 phase** (**G2-Phase**), it binds to its partner, `cdk1`, forming the inactive `MPF Complex (MPF-Komplex)`. The complex is then activated by specific phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events to trigger entry into M phase.  
- Protein phosphorylation changes the form to fit with other proteins  
- `Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) (Leukämie-Inhibitorischer Faktor)` is a critical cytokine used to maintain the **pluripotency** (Pluripotenz) of mouse `Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs)` in culture.

### On First Day After Fertilization
Male pronucleus: $h_p$ low, $h_a$ high, $mRNA_m$ low, $DNA_m$ low (de novo intially — almost completely demethylated)
Female pronucleus: $h_p$ high, $h_a$ low, $mRNA_m$ high, $DNA_m$ high
$\implies$Male Pronucleus has a **higher level of transcription** than Female Pronucleus

### `MPF`  
#mpf  
- `MPF` dephosphorylation -> active form. The `Cdk1` component of the inactive `MPF complex` is kept inactive by an **inhibitory phosphate group**.  
- Cumulous cells control egg maturation by `MPF` phosphorylation  
- Before fertilization, `MPF` is high -> keeps egg in Metaphase II  
	- **Elaboration:** After the first meiotic division (Meiosis I) is complete, the high `MPF` level maintains the egg in a second arrest at **Metaphase II** (**Metaphase II**). This is the stage at which the egg is ovulated and ready to be fertilized.
- After fertilization, `MPF` level goes down, cell completes meiosis  
	- **Elaboration:** Upon **fertilization** (**Befruchtung**), the resulting calcium wave triggers the activation of the `Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C)`. The `APC/C` degrades `Cyclin B (Cyclin B)` (the binding partner of `Cdk1`) and other regulatory proteins. This rapid drop in `Cyclin B/MPF` activity signals the completion of **Meiosis II** (**Meiose II**) and the formation of the **pronuclei** (**Vorkerne**).  

### Types of Stem Cells 
#stem-cell
- Totipotent stem cells: Totipotent stem cells are one of the most important stem cells types because they have the potential to develop into full- term development. For example: Zygote, 2-cell embryos, 4 cell embryos and early 8-cell embryos.  
- Pluripotent stem cells: Pluripotent stem cells are often termed 'true' stem cells because they have the potential to differentiate into almost any cell in the body. For example: Embryonic stem cells, `induced pluripotent stem (iPS)` cells. 
- Multipotent stem cells: A multipotent stem cell can give rise to other types of cells but it is limited in its ability to differentiate. For example: a multipotent blood stem cell is a hematopoietic cell  
- Oligopotent stem cells: Oligopotency is the ability of progenitor cells to differentiate into a few cell types. For example: lymphoid cell specifically, can give rise to various blood cells such as B and T cells.  
- Unipotent cells: A unipotent cell is the concept that one stem cell has the capacity to differentiate into only one cell type.

### Cytosol
- Occupies about 55% of total cell volume
- Semi-liquid portion of cytoplasm that surrounds the organelles
- Contains cytoskeleton
- Activities associated with gelatinous portion of cytoplasm

### Cytoskeleton
- Complex protein network protein of cytosol that acts as “bone and muscle” of cell
- Three distinct elements
	- Microtubules
	- Microfilaments
	- Intermediate filaments

| Element | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| Microtubules | - Transport secretory vesicles <br>- Movement of specialized cell projections <br>- Form mitotic spindle during cell division <br>- Contain Tubulin protein|
| Microfilaments | - Contractile systems <br>- Mechanical stiffeners <br>- Contain 2 chains of Actin protein|
| Intermediate filaments | - Resist stress <br>- Contain Keratin|

## Differentiation Pathway
![[Differentiation_Pathway.png]]

- `OCT-4` always active unless inhibited by `cdx2` (becomes trophectoderm cells)  
- `OCT-4` + `Nanog` expressed -> ICM cells  
- `OCT-4` + `Stat3` -> no telomere shortening (aging)  
- `OCT-4` alone -> Hypoblast -> Yolk sac  
---

## **Cell Cycle Overview**
### **1. Interphase**

* **G₁ phase (Gap 1)**: Cell grows and prepares for DNA replication.
	* `MPF`: inactive.
* **S phase (Synthesis)**: DNA is replicated.
	* `MPF`: still inactive.
* **G₂ phase (Gap 2)**: Cell prepares for mitosis; `Cyclin B` is synthesized.
	- **`MPF` starts accumulating**, but initially inactive until activation steps occur.

---

### **2. Mitosis / Meiosis Entry**

* **`MPF` (`Cyclin B` + `CDK1`)**:

  * **Inactive** → cell stays in $G_2$.
  * **Active** → triggers mitotic events:

    * Chromosome condensation
    * Nuclear envelope breakdown
    * Spindle formation
    * Chromosome alignment

* In oocytes:

  * `MPF` activity rises → oocyte arrested at **Metaphase II** (meiosis)
  * Arrest maintained by `CSF`

---

### **3. Metaphase II Arrest (in oocytes)**

* `CSF (Cytostatic Factor)` maintains **high `MPF`**.
* **Mechanism**: `CSF` inhibits `APC/C`, preventing `Cyclin B` degradation → meiosis cannot proceed.
* Chromosomes stay aligned on spindle; cell waits for fertilization.

---

### **4. Fertilization / Exit from Metaphase II**

* Sperm entry → **$Ca^{2+}$ oscillations** → `CSF` inactivation.
* `APC/C` activated → `Cyclin B` degraded → **`MPF` drops**.
* Oocyte completes meiosis II → second polar body extruded → female pronucleus formed → zygote enters interphase.

---

### **Key Points**

* **`MPF`**: “Go signal” for mitosis/meiosis; drives nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation.
* **`CSF`**: “Stop signal” at metaphase II; keeps `MPF` high until fertilization.
* **Fertilization**: releases the stop (`CSF`), `MPF` drops, meiosis completes.

## ATP Production (Cell Respiration)
#atp
![[Cell_Respiration.png]]
1. **Glycolysis (cytosol)**
	Glucose ($1 \text{ } C_6H_{12}O_6$) -> 2 Pyruvate ( $2\text{ }C_3H_4O_3$)
2. **Citric acid cycle (Krebs Cycle)**: Mitochondrial Matrix
3. **Oxydative phosphorylation**: Mitochondrial Inner Membrane
### Oxidative Phosphorylation
1. The high-eneregy electrons extracted from the hydrogens in $NADH$ & $FADH_2$ are transferred from one electron-carrier molecular to another
2. $NADH \to NAD^{+} + H^{+} + e^{-}$
$FADH_{2} \to FAD^{+} + H^{+} + e^{-}$
3. $e^{-}+O_2+H^{+} \to H_2O$
4. $H^{+} + ADP + Pi \to ATP$

![[Cell_Respiration_2.png]]

### Anaerobic vs. Aerobic Respiration
- Anaerobic condition, only 2 `ATP` are produced/glucose molecule processed
- Aerobic condition, a total of 32 `ATP` are produced/glucose molecule

### WHAT TO REMEMBER IN `ATP` PRODUCTION
1. Number of `ATP` produced.
2. Location of each phase

## Types of Embryo Based on Genomic Proportions  

|**Embryo Type (Embryo-Typ)**|**Mgen : Pgen Proportion**|**Total Ploidy (Gesamt-Ploidie)**|**Nuclear Origin (Nukleus-Ursprung)**|**Key Developmental Outcome (Entwicklungsergebnis)**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Fertilized (Normal) Embryo**|**50% Mgen : 50% Pgen**|Diploid ($\mathbf{2n}$)|Balanced contribution from an egg and one sperm.|**Viable** (Lebensfähig); required for normal development.|
|**Parthenogenetic Embryo** (Haploid/Diploid)|**100% Mgen : 0% Pgen**|Haploid ($\mathbf{n}$) or Diploid ($\mathbf{2n}$)|Only maternal nuclear DNA (Nur mütterliche DNA); no paternal genome.|**Non-Viable** (Nicht lebensfähig). Results in good embryonic structures but critically lacks the paternal genes needed for placenta/trophoblast formation.|
|**Androgenetic Diploid Embryo**|**0% Mgen : 100% Pgen**|Diploid ($\mathbf{2n}$)|Only paternal nuclear DNA (Nur väterliche DNA); no maternal genome.|**Non-Viable** (Nicht lebensfähig). Results in excellent placental development but lacks the maternal genes needed for forming the embryo proper.|
|**Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer (SCNT) Embryo**|**50% Mgen : 50% Pgen**|Diploid ($\mathbf{2n}$)|Nucleus from a differentiated (differenzierten) somatic cell is placed into an enucleated egg.|Outcome depends on successful **Reprogramming** (Reprogrammierung) of the differentiated nucleus by the egg's cytoplasm. Used for cloning.|
|**Haploidized Somatic Nucleus (♀) and Sperm Embryo**|**25% Mgen : 75% Pgen**|Triploid ($\mathbf{3n}$)|One haploid maternal genome and two haploid paternal genomes.|**Non-Viable** (Nicht lebensfähig). Triploid state with a strong **paternal bias**; leads to massive placental overgrowth and lethal fetal underdevelopment.|
|**Tetraploid Embryos (4n)**|**50% Mgen : 50% Pgen** (Typically)|Tetraploid ($\mathbf{4n}$)|Doubled set of chromosomes, often created by fusing two normal $2n$ blastomeres.|**Non-Viable** (Nicht lebensfähig). Used experimentally, but cannot support development past early stages due to abnormal cell size and number.|

# Intro to Biomed
Day 4 onward -> cell no longer totipotent (only zygote to 2-cell or 4-cell stage). At 8-cell stage, compaction happens due to e-cadherin. At blastocyst stage, 1st differentiation occurs.
250,000 to 300,000 eggs total, 10k die each month, only 1 mature

ZGA (Zygotic Gene Activation)

First differentiation: cdx2 (cells become trophectoderm)and oct4 (cells become ICM)

Late 8-cell embryos: compaction begins by E-cadherin gene

Blastocyst formation, then escapes zona pellucida to prepare for implantation (called Blastocyst hatching). If it fails, try breaking down the zona pellucida

Dead cells: cell membrane dissolve. To check, stain cells with dye (excluded dye=alive)

Down syndrome: trisomy 21

PGD requires stopping cell in Metaphase by inhibiting cell in polymerization (actin - microtubules)

For IMPLANTATION: from 2-cell to morula (includng 8-cell embryo) goes to oviduct (for Hatching); blastocyst goes to uterus (may otherwise lead to thụ tinh ngoài tử cung - ectopic pregnancy).

15000 Telomere base pairs: fetus
10000 base pairs: baby
5000 base pairs: old age
"9 months 10 days is equal to the life you live"

Yamanaka factors do not activate genes, they transfer genes

ANIMAL CLONING: Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer (SCNT). Mother nucleus transferred into empty oocyte

On first day after fertilization:
Male pronucleus: h_p low, h_a high, mRNA_m low, DNA_m low (de novo (read, completely demethylated) initially)
Female pronucleus: h_p high, h_a low, mRNA_m high, DNA_m high

MPF active: nuclear membrane breakdown, chromosomes condense, spindle (microtubules) formation. Leads cell to Metaphase
MPF inactive: converse. Leads cell to G1
PHOSPHORYLATED MPF = INACTIVE

MPF: Cyclin + Cdk1. Cyclin B degraded after use. EARLY LIFE: causes zygote to divide into multicellular embryo, but no G1 phase. Also regulates differentiation. CYTOKINESIS: controls formation of mitotic spindle and separation of daughter cells

WHAT HAPPENS AFTER SPERM ENTERS EGG
Egg completes Meiosis II
Zygote development initiated
Egg forms female pronucleus

If epididymis is faulty, round sperms form.

Fast block (depolarize membrane) and slow block (remove sperm receptors). Smooth ER contains Ca2+. Uses IP3 channels

IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTROL MANUALLY SO FAR
Dephosphorylation can change shape of receptors
At fertilization, maternal nucleus is smaller than paternal -> paternal gene transcription activity is higher (more loosened chromatin)

Mature egg: Diploid (finished Meiosis I)
Mature sperm: Haploid (Meiosis II)

First day: Pronucleus (tiền nhân)
De novo DNA Methylation (sperm cells only)

Transgenic animals: all cells have modified genes. Inserted in single-cell embryos (male pronucleus specifically).
HOW TO PRODUCE TRANSGENIC ANIMALS:
1. Pronuclear DNA microinjection.
2. Viral-mediated gene transfer. 
3. CRISPR-Cas9. 
4. Transgenic Somatic Cell Line -> SCNT
5. ICSI mediated gene transfer.
6. Inject transgenic ES cells into blastocyst, let it develop; if transgenic ES cells contribute to germ cells, the offspring will be fully transgenic.
7. Tetraploid Embryo Complementation: combine tetraploid placenta with transgenic ES fetus.

If more than 70% of transgenic animals have transgenic cell, then the transgenic cells will contribute to germ cells.

*When injecting transgenic ES cells into blastocyst, only fetus contains transgenic cells, not the placenta. Hypothesis: transgenic ES cells are not totipotent.*

HOW TO PRODUCE CHIMERAS
1. Blastocyst injection: ES cell injection into blastocyst or morula
2. Embryonic Aggregation: aggregate (not fuse) 2 or more embryos at 8-cell or morula stage. Remove zona pellucida using tyrode acid. Articifial aggregation: success rate 30-40%.
3. Tetraploid Complementation: inject ES cells from 2 different lines into tetraploid blastocyst -> ES cells (2 types) for fetus + tetraploid for placenta

NATURAL CHIMERAS
Two fertilized zygotes or early embryos aggregate together. NEED ZONA PELLUCIDA TO DISSOLVE OR THE EMBRYOS SHOULD BE HATCHING
Microchimerism: baby's cells cross into mother's body
Blood chimerism: exchange blood stem cells
Grafting in plants

APPLICATIONS OF CHIMERAS
Demontrate perfect pluripotency of ES cell lines
Create bioorgans

CREATING RAT PANCREAS IN MOUSE
Mouse somatic cell, Pdx1 knockout -> SCNT -> Cloned Pdx1 knockout blastocyst
Rat somatic cells -> iPSCs-> inject into Cloned Pdx1 blastocyst

ICSI uses freeze-dried sperm (ice removed via Sublimation at low pressure). Triton X-100 and freeze-thawing (creates crystal) damage cells. Only works for sperm heads, not somatic cells, because chromosomes are maximally condensed in sperms.

Nucleolus: "black horse," contributes to ribosome synthesis, cannot be dyedalways appear black)

NO ACTIVATION: artificial activation (chemical or electric). If using another sperm, its mitochondria would get left behind and contaminate the zygote.

Ca2+ released -> Cortical granule contents released -> Simulate cell division, DNA synthesis, RNA translation. ALSO SLOW BLOCK.

MPF: Nuclear membrane breakdown, chromosome condense, spindle forms, leads to Metaphase. Gets activated by dephosphorylation to enter Metaphase.

TYPES OF EMBRYO:
Zygotic Embryo
Pathenogenetic embryo: formed without fertilization. Cannot fully develop due to the lack of paternal imprinted genes and the doubling of maternal imprinted genes.
Androgenetic embryo: only paternal DNA
Gynogenetic embryo: only maternal DNA
Tetraploid embryo: 4n. Can only form placenta
SCNT embryo

STEPS IN ART
PGD (optional), IVG, IVM, IVF, ICSI, ROSI
IVD (development), Embryo Transfer

Inside follicles, the eggs are tightly surrounded by cumulous cells

Phosphorylated MPF = Inactive

In maturation, cumulous are more loose. cAMP level goes down, MPF dephosphorylate

GTH, FSH, LH released by pituitary gland (controlled by GnRH from hypothalamus)

Zygote -> 2 cell embryo -> 4 cell embryo -> 8 cell embryo -> morula -> blastocyst

GFP flourescent qgene is extracted from jellyfish

First differentiation: cdx2 causes formation of ICM and trophoblast,which becomes fetus and placenta respectively

Estrogen increases during ovulation
Progesterone increases during pregnancy (pregnancy hormone)
Estrogen decreases after mãn kinh

Hypothalamus-> anterior pituitary glands (produces LH, FSH) -> Theca cells produce estrogen

Posterior pituitary glands produce oxytocin (love hormone) for easier delivery. Only inject oxytocin when natural delivery is impossible, otherwise might break the uterus.

iPS cells problem: the use of retroviral and lentiviral vectors & transgenic cells. Solution: protein and nanobot transfer

ICM -> fetus
Trophectoderm cells 

Activate paternal genes within the embryo using CRISPR gene editing
Serial nuclear transfer (proven) to create parthenogenetic placentas
Tetraploidal placentas
Create artificial placenta
Epigenetic reprogramming
Chimera: use androgenetic placenta, SNT-derived placenta, or tetraploid placenta

HOW TO CREATE PARTHENOGENETIC EMBRYO FROM 1 EGG
1. Mature egg
2. Activation
3. Prevent cell division (cytokinesis) using Cytochalasin B which inhibits microactin
4. Two n nucleus form
5. Cell undergoes S phase again to create two 2n nucleus
6. These nucleus proceed to metaphase
7. After mitosis, we get a 2-cell diploid embryo

HOW TO CREATE ANDROGENETIC DIPLOID EMBRYO
1.Enucleate mature egg
2. Inject two sperms
3. Activate egg
4. Two n nucleus enter S phase

2ND METHOD: ELECTROFUSION

Microtubules create splindle, helps cell motility
Actin (microfilaments) form contractile rings (polymerization) for cytokinesis

Early fetal dev, we have both ovary and testis, determined by SRY gene in Y chromosome.

Zygote to 2-cell diploid only has 20% success rate. Why?

Why can't we use tetraploid embryo for ES cells?

APPLICATIONS OF SCNT TECH
1. Rare genomic preservation
2. Cell reprogramming
3. Transgenic animals
4. SCNT ES cells
5. Pharming
6. Human bioorgans

WAYS TO CREATE TETRAPLOID
Electrofusion (blastomeres from 2-cell stage embryo)
Inhibition of one cell cycle using CB

APPLICATIONS OF TETRAPLOID
Creating modified plants
Studying pluripotent cells
Creating chimera

TYPES OF BACKGROUND ANIMALS
Inbred animals: Genotype = Phenotype
Outbred animals: Different genotype, Same phenotype. Mostly used for drug testing
Hybrid animals: Same genotype, Different phenotype. Lay lots of egg: 50-60 per superovulation. Good at caring for offspring.
