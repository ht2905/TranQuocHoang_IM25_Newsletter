Current Chosen Topic: The Immunological Effects of Microplastics.
Focus: How the chronic ingestion or inhalation of microplastics (Mikroplastik)—a ubiquitous environmental pollutant—affects gut immunity (Darmimmunität) and systemic inflammatory responses.

Research Question: What specific pharmacological or therapeutic interventions are currently being researched to reverse or mitigate microplastic-induced chronic inflammation within the human gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT)?

Introduction Heading not required as per APA standard."Because the first paragraphs of a paper are understood to be introductory, the heading 'Introduction' is not needed. Do not begin a paper with an 'Introduction'heading; the paper title at the top of the first page of text acts as a de facto Level 1 heading." Though, on second thought, I will still include Introduction heading in case the TA is ignorant of the correct formatting.
